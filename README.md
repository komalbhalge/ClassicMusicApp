# ClassicMusicApp

This is a simple demo app for playing audio files from the device/phone.
Here I have used [MediaPlayer](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html)

Features:
*View all the audio files from device in a List.
*Play audios in background even if app is not in foreground, for this, I have used [NotificationChannel](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel)
*Notification displayed is interactive.
*You can Play/Pause, Skip to Next/Previous from notification itself. 
*Audio information /metadata can shown in Audio Play Screen as well as in Notifications.
